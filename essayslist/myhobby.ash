                                                                   MY HOBBY
A hobby is something that you love to get involve with, in your pass time or in leisure. It is the first thing that comes to your mind when you get bored. I also have a hobby that I like to get involved in whenever I have time – drawing.

Since childhood, I have developed an interest for drawing and love to make sketches, filling a white sheet of paper with life and colors. I don’t know what prompted me towards drawing; nevertheless it is my favourite pastime and my favourite hobby.

Drawing has many mental benefits apart from improving your drawing skills with every new sketch you make. It improves your imagination as your mind constantly juggles through the thoughts of making new figures and filling it with colors.

To draw a sketch in detail you need to be focused and keep your mind concentrated, eliminating any kind of external distraction. The attention to detail that you put in the drawing will require all your imagination and concentration. The ability to concentrate while doing a particular job stays with you always in other works as well.

Drawing is good for the development of the brain and hand-eye coordination. You will constantly think new thins to draw and immediately start giving it shape on paper, working your eyes, brain and hand in synchronization. Drawing is a wonderful hobby which could be fun and in my opinion everyone should take up drawing as a pass time activity if not a full time hobby.
