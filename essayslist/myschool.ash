                                                                    MY SCHOOL
My school is located just a few kilometers from city centre and is easily accessible by road. It has a sprawling green campus with a beautiful garden and a large ground. The garden lies at the centre and can be viewed from almost all of the classes. We often sit in the garden during the recess and take our lunch, but we take care not to make it dirty or spill food.

My school is also a wonderful place where my personality gets shaped and my intellect gets improved with education. It transforms me from a living human being to a more sensible and meaningful self, with dreams, aspirations and a confidence to achieve them.

It does so many wonderful things in my life. I learn music, dance, play sports, take part in competitions and show my skills to others. I also learn how to behave and carry myself in society.

There is much more than education that I will be grateful to my school for providing me. I learn here about the social and other issues which hampers the growth of the nation. I also learn about how together we can overcome these obstacles and set our country on the path of progress.

Every time I think of my school, I think of it as a temple of education. A temple, where my soul meets education, making my life more meaningful and useful to the society and the nation as well.
