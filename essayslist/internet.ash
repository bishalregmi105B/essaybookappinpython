Introduction:
The advancements in technology have changed our lives in several ways, including how we communicate, how we do business, how we run our social and personal lives, etc. Thanks to the internet and the World Wide Web, the earth is now a global village. However, like the two sides of the coin, there are always some disadvantages of the internet and the technology.

Let’s see the disadvantages of the internet in the following paragraphs:

Spamming:
Spamming is the dumping of bulk e-mails which are not solicited by the users. These e-mails can clog the whole system and serve no purpose. The spam e-mails can also contain potential threats like viruses, details of illegal activities, or soliciting money from the users.

Information theft:
The internet contains everything and anything freely available. These opportunities pave way for misuse of information. We may also have come across situations where people steal information from someone’s research and share it as their own.

Identity theft and security breach:
This is one of the scariest disadvantages of internet. People’s identities are stolen and misused and at times, their privacy and security are breached to an extent that many people lose their lives or money because of this terrifying loophole on the internet.

Impact on children:
Continuous surfing and the variety of games found on the internet make the children addicted to the internet. Children tend to constantly use the system and thereby, their communication potential and attitude changes, are hampered to a great extent. This is another major disadvantage of the internet that is a sure shot possibility of spoiling the next generation. The violence in the games also affects the psychology of the children. Additionally, the adult contents that are freely available on the internet share unwanted and wrong information about sexuality and related things.

Impact on the health:
Apart from these, the continuous use of the internet can cause lifestyle disorders not only for the children but also for adults. Sitting in front of the computer for a prolonged time can affect your eyesight, cause obesity and related disorders. People tend to lose their productive time and get addicted to internet surfing. Such usage is considered as another major disadvantage of the internet because it hampers the productive time and quality time in the workplace and at home.

Depression:
Although the internet is extensively used in the workplace, it can cause depression in human minds. Considering the availability of internet and VPN with which you can access your office materials from anywhere, a working person is expected to be available for the job throughout the day and night. These facilities, in the long run, can cause depression waves not only in the minds of those who work but also in the minds of those who are dependent on these working personnel. Spending quality time with our loved ones reduce to a greater extent. People tend to become more mechanical and there is a definite loss of emotions.

Conclusion:
Although there are several advantages associated with the internet, we are also able to witness the horrendous disadvantages of the internet and its usage in all walks of life. It’s high time that we realize that technological advancements are like a double-edged sword and should be used wisely to live a quality life.
