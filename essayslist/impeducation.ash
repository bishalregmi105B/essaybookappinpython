                                                         IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION
“Education makes people easy to lead, but difficult to drive; easy to govern but impossible to enslave.”

The above quote aptly testifies to the importance of education. Education encompasses both the teaching and learning of knowledge, proper conduct and technical competency. Learning includes the moral values and improvement of character and methods to increase the strength of mind.
 
Education forms character, strengthens mind, increases knowledge and makes us independent. Education dispels ignorance. Education gives us opportunity to put our potentials to optimum use. Education is a reform for human mind. Without education, the training of the human mind is incomplete. The human mind was made to be trained and without education, a person is incomplete.

Education makes a person right thinker and an able decision-maker. And this can only be achieved by education which acquaints a person with knowledge of world around him and beyond, teaches him to reason and acquaints him with history, so that a person can be a better judge of the present.

Without education, man is like one who is confined to closed room with no place to exit or entry and completely shut from the outside world. But education lends man into the open world. An uneducated person cannot read and write and hence he is closed to all the knowledge and wisdom he can gain through books and other mediums. Uneducated or less educated have less opportunity to live a life of their choice.

A person that gets education will be more open to the avenues for life of his choice. An educated person will be a better citizen and an able decision-maker. This is the reason why people always prefer an educated or more educated person over an uneducated or less educated person for employment purposes even to do a job which does not require much of education, like a office attendant or a domestic help.

Each person has different level of understanding and learning but education sharpens and enhances them.


 
Thus, importance of education can never be undermined. All over the world people agree that education is the key to a healthy mind and a successful life.

Literacy rate of Nepal is 61% as contrast to 82% literacy rate of world. Female literacy rate is 54.16% as per the 2001 population census. These figures are not only embarrassing but also alarming.

Some people cannot attain education because of their socio-economic problems and some other are devoid of education due to lack of resources, but some other simply avoid taking education due to lack of awareness about importance of education.

Importance of education is well known that’s why education as a national policy is always given priority. The government is targeting right at the very cause of illiteracy and endeavouring hard to eradicate illiteracy. Government is running various literacy programmes like adult literacy programme, continuing education programme, weekend and part-time study programme, mid-day meal programme, free-education programme, etc. The success rate of these programmes is consistence but gradual.

It is also our duty as responsible and aware citizens to help government, thus our nation to achieve cherished dream of 100% literacy. We can not only spread awareness about importance of education but also we can help uneducated people to attain education by funding and assisting them for their studies.

A well educated nation makes a great nation. We can adopt the motto of ‘Each one teach one” in our lives. We can teach uneducated people around us, because even informal education is any day better than no education. Let us take the uneducated towards the light of education and glow the glory of our nation.

Let’s make our country more powerful by power of knowledge, i.e. education, to quote Francis Bacon: “Knowledge is power.”
