                                                                        POPULATION
Population is the term used to denote the total number of people living in an area. It does not only refer to the human beings but also to other forms of living organisms that have the ability to reproduce and multiply. The population in many parts of earth is increasing. While the governments of different countries are trying to curb the issue by various means, a lot still needs to be done in order to control it.

Importance of Population Control
The growing rate of population is a cause of several problems. The developing countries are struggling hard to reach up to the level of the developed countries and the rapid growth in the population in these countries is one of the main hindrances in this direction. The problem of unemployment is on all time high only because of the growing population. There are numerous people seeking jobs but the vacancies are limited. Unemployment causes poverty which is another problem. It also creates dissatisfaction among the people and gives rise to crime. Those who do not get their desired jobs often adopt unsolicited means to earn money.

It is also to be understood that the resources are limited but due to the increasing number of people the demand is growing higher. Forests are being cut and huge office and residential buildings are being made in their place. Why? It is all being done to accommodate the growing population. Natural resources are being depleted at a rapid pace because of greater number of people using them. This is causing an imbalance in the environment. More and more natural resources are being used to meet the demands of the people. This does not only cause degradation of the environment but also increases the cost of living. Controlling the population has thus become the need of the hour. It is necessary for establishing balance and harmony in the environment. It will also ensure better standard of living for people.

Possible Steps to Control Human Population
Here are a few possible steps to control the human population:
Education
People from the poor and uneducated classes are mostly the ones who do not plan family. They treat women as a child bearing machine and have children one after the other. It is essential to educate people. The government must take steps to make education necessary for all.

Family Planning
It is essential for the government to sensitize people about the importance of family planning. This should be done repeatedly by means of radio, television, internet and other forms of communication.

Monetary Benefits
The government should exempt the taxes or provide other monetary benefits to the families who have single child. Since people today are money driven, this will be an effective step towards controlling population. The governments of quite a few countries have already implemented such policies.

Fine or Penalty
Just as the government can provide monetary benefits to those who do proper family planning, it should also put a fine on the ones who do not. A penalty should be levied on the families with more than two children.

Strict Monitoring
The government must not only implement the aforementioned points but also keep a stark check on the same and ensure that these are followed.

Conclusion
People must understand the importance of controlling the population. It would not only give them a clean and green environment and a better standard of living but will also help in the overall development of their country. The government must also take this matter seriously and put proper rules and policies in place to ensure population control. Both the public and the government require working together to control this problem.
